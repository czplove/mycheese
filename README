Compiling:
To compile cheese, simply install all dependencies and then do a
'make'. you will end with the executable 'cheese'. Sorry for this,
but the next release will feature autotools, for shure! ;)

Installing:
  - copy cheese somewhere in your PATH (/usr/bin)
  - copy gpomme/cheese.desktop to /usr/share/applications
  - copy gpomme/cheese.glade to /usr/share/cheese

Using:
Simply launch 'cheese'. The taken photos will be stored in the folder images in your working path. e.g. if you start it from ~, you will end up with a folder ~/images.

How to get your camera working:
To get your camera working with cheese, you will have to ensure that
it works with the Gstreamer Framework and Video4Linux2 (v4l2). To
modify the input or the output simply run 'gstreamer-properties'
